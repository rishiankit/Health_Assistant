        android:text="In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism.\n Dietary habits are the habitual decisions an individual or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat.
        	The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos.
        	This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.
        	A particular diet may be chosen to seek weight loss or weight gain. Changing a subject's dietary intake, or going on a diet, can change the energy balance and increase or decrease the amount of fat stored by the body.
        	Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight. In other words, it is conscious control or restriction of the diet. 
        	Dieting is often used in combination with physical exercise to lose weight, commonly in those who are overweight or obese. Some people, however, follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle). 
        	Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight."
